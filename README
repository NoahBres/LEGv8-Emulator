README for LEGv8-Emulator Programming Assignment 2
Authors: Kyle Marek, Zach Mohling, Griffin Stout

Compilation and Testing Instructions

- to compile the project, type 'make' in the directory with the makefile 
  (LEGv8-Emulator/). This will compile and link all C files and headers, and 
  will generate an executable binary called 'legv8emul'.

- to test the compiled emulator, you will need to have previously assembled a
  .legv8asm file using the legv8asm binary with the -a flag. This will produce
  a '.legv8asm.machine' binary. Then, run the legv8emul binary with a single
  argument: the binary file you just assembled. 

- how to read the output: The default output of a completed run of the emulator
  is a DUMP. This prints out a) the value of all registers in hex and base 10,
  b) the state of the simulated stack, and c) the state of the simulated main 
  memory at the end of the program.
